# Summary

You already know what you are doing on the third of March?
Yes? Then this could be something for you. :-)
<br /> 
1:1 scale (Original size)
You can illuminate the screen with Led's
<br /> 
___
<br /> 
#####There are two Joycon versions:

-One with a bare joycon body and separated buttons. This version is marked with a “-x-“ in the filename.
-A solid one with buttons and Joycon body in one piece. ( -z- )
<br /> 
#####There three console versions:

-A two-part model that you can use with LEDs. ( -y- )
-A solid single piece model. ( -w- )
-A solid two-piece model for smaller 3d printers. ( -k- )
<br /> 
___

<br /> 
#####** Instructions**
- Print with infill, no support.
- Glue the parts together.
- Print "screen.pdf", cut it out and stick it to the front of the console
  If you use LED’s, I recommend to print the "screen.pdf" twice and glue one on top of the other.
<br /> 
- #####Upload a photo and enjoy the anticipation!
